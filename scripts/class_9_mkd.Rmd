This is an R Markdown document. I can type whatever I want.

**This is bold**
*This is italic*

### This will make the font bigger
 
## This will make the font even bigger

echo= false means it won't show the code chunk, just the output 

suppressPackageStartupMessages can be used to wrap around the loading of the tidyverse package so all of those messages don't appear, for just that line
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(storms)

library(viridis)

ggplot(storms) +
  geom_jitter(aes(as.factor(month), pressure, fill = wind), pch = 21, alpha = 0.05) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Hurricane Pressure v Month", subtitle = "with Max Wind Speed", x = "Month")

```
 
 writing out equations in Rmarkdown
 
 If you want to write an equation, you put a dollar sign on either side of it
 
 $\sum_{i=y}^n X_i$
 
```{r}
library(knitr)

kable(head(storms), caption = "Table using Kable")

htmlTable::htmlTable(head(storms))

#make an interactive table
 DT::datatable(storms)
```
 
```{r}
library(plotly)


ggplotly(
  ggplot(storms) +
  geom_jitter(aes(as.factor(month), pressure, fill = wind), pch = 21, alpha = 0.05) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Hurricane Pressure v Month", subtitle = "with Max Wind Speed", x = "Month"))

```
